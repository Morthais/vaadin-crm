# Overview

This is a simple Java Web App built to demonstrate my knowledge of the Java Language.

I wrote this program because I was curious if I could build a Web App using Java.

[Software Demo Video TBD](http://youtube.link.goes.here)

# Development Environment

### Tools and Technologies
- Java Development Kit (Amazon Corretto 11)
- Maven (builds structure, dependencies, artifacts)
- Git/GitHub (version control)
- Node.js (used by Vaadin)
- IntelliJ IDE

### Programming Language and Libraries
- Java
- Vaadin (Java framework for building web applications front-end)
- Spring Boot (takes care of starting and configuring the server)
- Spring Data (database data access)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to better understand the fundamentals of Java before building a Web App
* Learn how to add and remove Vaadin UI modules to make the web app my own
* Better understand the mechanics of a web app using Python then start from scratch
